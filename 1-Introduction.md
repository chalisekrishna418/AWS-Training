## AWS Regions
- **AWS Regions** are distinct geographical location where AWS computing resources are hosted.
- Each region is designed to be completely isolated from the other regions.
- As of Apr 2022, there are 26 AWS Regions.

## AWS Availability Zones
- **Availability Zones** are isolated locations of datacenters within a each region. 
- There can be 1 or more availability zone in each region. 
- Availability Zones are connected with low latency, high throughput, and highly redundant networking.
